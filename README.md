# reddit-research-tool

A lightweight, read-only data collection tool for academic research.

This application retrieves publicly available Reddit posts and comments related to  
topics such as Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF), nonprofit regulation,  
public policy, and discourse analysis in the UK and Nigeria.

The goal is to support qualitative and quantitative research using keyword-based  
search and structured data export. The tool does not post, vote, message, or  
interact with Redditors. It only collects and processes publicly available data.
